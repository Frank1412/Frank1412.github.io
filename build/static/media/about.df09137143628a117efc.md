# Intro

I'm a motivated Blockchain Security researcher(Syracuse University) with a proven track record of optimizing Blockchain security and deployment processes. Before Ph.D, I got Master of Science degree from [Rutgers University](https://www.rutgers.edu/) and a Bachelor of Engineering degree from [Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications](https://www.cqupt.edu.cn/). In my spare time, I am particularly interested in projects with high social impact and I'm a super fan of badminton and Chinese Go. If you think I can be helpful to you or your cause and would like to meet, please feel free to get in touch.
